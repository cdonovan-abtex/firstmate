# Ship landing

[`bin/fm-dod-lib.sh`](../../../bin/fm-dod-lib.sh) owns the ready-signal spelling and publication requirements for each delivery mode and forge, including Gerrit changes.
A lane that deliberately holds a draft PR declares a wait instead; `bin/fm-pr-check.sh` refuses to arm merge monitoring on a draft.
Run `bin/fm-pr-check.sh <id> <PR url>` with the URL copied from that ready signal or the resolved checks-green `fm-crew-state.sh` line - it records `pr=` and the forge's `pr_head=` when available in the task's meta and arms the watcher's merge poll.
Read delivery readiness through `bin/fm-crew-state.sh`; `bin/fm-pr-check.sh` and the secondmate publisher share its delivery gate from `bin/fm-dod-lib.sh`.
If the ready signal is blocked by that gate, steer the worker through its mode and forge's delivery contract on the commit the refusal names rather than waiting.
Tell the captain the PR's full `https://...` URL copied from the worker's ready line, the resolved checks-green crew-state line, or the task's `pr=` metadata, a concise outcome summary, and the no-mistakes risk level when applicable.
A captain instruction to merge is explicit authority; `yolo` is the only standing routine merge authority.
For any custom `state/<id>.check.sh` you write yourself, keep it an ordinary single-link mode-`0700` file, print one line only when firstmate should wake, print nothing otherwise, finish before `FM_CHECK_TIMEOUT`, then bind its current bytes with `bin/fm-check-register.sh <id>` before the watcher may execute it.
Retire a custom check only through `bin/fm-check-unregister.sh <id>` (or `bin/fm-teardown.sh` for a spawned task); never hand-compose an `rm` with `$STATE`/`$ID`.

Tear down a ship task only after landing is confirmed.
A teardown refusal for uncommitted or unlanded work is a stop-and-investigate result, never an obstacle to bypass.
Never force teardown without explicit discard authority.
After successful teardown, record completion, retain only the configured recent Done history, and re-evaluate queued work whose blockers and time gates have cleared.

A secondmate is persistent and an empty queue is healthy.
Retire one only on an explicit captain or main-firstmate decision, after loading `secondmate-provisioning`; its home must contain no work under way, and forced discard still requires explicit captain authority.
